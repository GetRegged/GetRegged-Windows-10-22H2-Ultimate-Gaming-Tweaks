# üëè About
GetRegged's Performance Batch is an Open Source Tweaker that was designed to improve computer performance and latency. The Tweaker is interactive so it allows the user to optimize their PC however they please. It is important to note that the results may vary depending on the system's configuration.

1. Registry Files:
The tweaker gives you the possibility to tweak the Windows-Registry to get the maximum performance out of your hardware and protect your privacy by disabling unneeded backgroud processes, unwanted data tracking, prioritizing tasks, stabilizing your network connection, reducing latency, framedrops and more!

2. Power Plan:
Additionally, a custom power management profile designed specifically for users who want to maximize their system's performance and responsiveness for ultralow latency, particularly in scenarios such as gaming and resource-intensive tasks, is also provided. This power plan forces your system to operate at its absolute maximum capacity, especially in the most demanding scenarios.

3. Temp Cleaner:
A cleaner to remove unnecessary and system-slowing temporary files from the hard drive is also available. By using this cleaning tool, you can quickly remove all cache, log files, and other unnecessary data that accumulates over time clearing valuable storage space and allowing your system to run smoothly and efficiently.
