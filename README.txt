The Windows-Registry is designed to work well for all normal users. It is made,
to ensure the system functions properly for everyday tasks. It is typically set
up by Windows to be suitable for general use without specialized optimizations.
Every user has the possibility to edit the Windows-Registry to fit their needs,
which must be done with caution, because wrong changes could brick your System.

1. Registry Files:
GetRegged is mainly focused on tweaking the Windows-Registry to get the maximum
performance out of your hardware and protect your privacy by disabling unneeded
backgroud processes, unwanted data tracking, prioritizing tasks, balancing your
network connection, reducing latency, framedrops and more!

2. Power Plan:
Additionally, a custom power management profile designed specifically for users
who want to maximize their system's performance and responsiveness for ultralow
latency, particularly in scenarios such as gaming and resource-intensive tasks,
is also provided. This power plan forces your system to operate at its absolute 
maximum capacity, especially in the most demanding scenarios.

3. Temp Cleaner:
A cleaner to remove unnecessary and system-slowing temporary files from the hard
drive is also available. By using this cleaning tool, you can quickly remove all
cache, log files, and other unnecessary data that accumulates over time clearing
valuable storage space and allowing your system to run smoothly and efficiently.
