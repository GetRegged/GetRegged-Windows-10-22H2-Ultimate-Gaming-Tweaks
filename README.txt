The Windows-Registry is designed to work well for all normal users. It is made,
to ensure the system functions properly for everyday tasks. It is typically set
up by Windows to be suitable for general use without specialized optimizations.
Every user has the possibility to edit the Windows-Registry to fit their needs,
which must be done with caution, because wrong changes could brick your System.

GetRegged is solely focused on tweaking the Windows-Registry to get the maximum
performance out of your hardware and protect your privacy by disabling unneeded
backgroud processes, unwanted data tracking, prioritizing tasks, stabilize your
network connection, reducing latency, framedrops and more!
